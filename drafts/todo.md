- setup internachi
- setup homepage 


its a laravel project. using internaci modular package. now I made a module names ui-frontend.

all layout will be like <x-ui-frontend::layout> </x-ui-frontend::layout>

what I expect is a layout file using
- header partials
- scripts partials
- nav partials
- footer partials


nav style. can be choose theme dark and light theme for tailwind. can change website language [2 type of language choice, website language and content language] - normally all website having only single language choice. use flag emoji for that. currently website language is english, bangla, hindi and espanol. 

flowbite could be an option. user avatar. when click upon avatar show dropdown menu like login, register, logout. profile dashboard

```
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "title",
        "slug": "slug",
        "display_order": 1,
        "section": "",
        "series": "",
        "is_current": true
    },
]
```
